% Salutation
Sir/Madam,

\vspace{0.3cm}

% Main Content
I am directed to state that in pursuance of the recommendations of the Committee on Financial Governance and with the approval of the Finance Minister, new Financial Reporting Guidelines have been formulated to standardize financial reporting across all Government of India Ministries and Departments.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\officeline{2. Background}\\
The existing financial reporting framework has been in operation since 2010 and requires substantial enhancement to align with contemporary best practices in public financial management. The need for greater transparency, accountability, and comparability in financial reporting has become increasingly important in the current economic environment.

\vspace{0.3cm}

\officeline{3. Key Features of New Guidelines}\\
The revised guidelines incorporate the following significant improvements:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Accrual-based Accounting}: Transition from cash-based to accrual-based accounting for better financial position reflection
    \item \textbf{Unified Chart of Accounts}: Standardized account codes across all ministries and departments
    \item \textbf{Enhanced Disclosure Requirements}: More comprehensive reporting of contingent liabilities and commitments
    \item \textbf{Quarterly Financial Statements}: Mandatory quarterly reporting instead of annual reporting only
    \item \textbf{Performance Indicators}: Integration of financial and non-financial performance metrics
    \item \textbf{Audit Trail Requirements}: Strengthened documentation and audit trail provisions
\end{enumerate}

\vspace{0.3cm}

\officeline{4. Implementation Schedule}\\
The implementation will be carried out in phases to ensure smooth transition:

Phase III - Full Implementation & 01.10.2026 onwards \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

All Ministries and Departments are requested to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Appoint a nodal officer for implementation of these guidelines
    \item Conduct gap analysis of existing systems and processes
    \item Submit implementation plans to this Department by 31.01.2026
    \item Ensure compliance with the new reporting format from 01.10.2026
\end{itemize}
